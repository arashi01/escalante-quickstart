#standard-helloworld-lift: Standard Hello World Lift Example

Author: Galder Zamarre√±o

##What is it?

This example demonstrates that Escalante can deploy the standard, original,
helloworld example, where the war file contains all the jars required by the
Lift application, including the Scala libraries.

##System requirements

The example can be deployed using Maven from the command line or from Eclipse
using JBoss Tools or JBoss Developer Studio.

To set up Maven or JBoss Tools in Eclipse, refer to the
[Getting Started Developing Applications Guide](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Getting+Started+Developing+Applications+Guide)

If you're using Eclipse, or JBoss Developer Studio,
[a couple of extra steps are required in order to be able to develop Scala applications]
(http://escalante.io/quickstarts/#jboss_developer_studio_for_scala_developers).

## Deploying the application

### JBoss Developer Studio

To deploy the application to Escalante using JBoss Developer Studio:

1. Import project into workspace
2. Go to `Servers` tab and click on `new server wizard`
3. Select `JBoss AS 7.1` and change `Server name` to: **Escalante**
4. Click `Next` and select the home directory of Escalante

6. Click `Finish` in the wizard
7. Right-click on the Escalante server and click `Start`
8. Check the the application is deployed to
